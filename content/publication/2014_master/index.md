  Future processor will not be limited by the transistor resources, but will be
  mainly constrained by energy efficiency. Reconfigurable architecture offers
  higher energy efficiency than CPUs through customized hardware and more
  flexibility than ASICs. FPGAs allow configurability at bit level to keep both
  efficiency and flexibility. However, in many computation-intensive
  applications, only word level customizations are necessary, which inspires
  coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays(CGRAs) to raise configurability to word
  level and to reduce configuration information, and to enable on-the-fly
  customization. Traditional CGRAs are designed in the era when transistor
  resources are scarce. Previous work in CGRAs share hardware resources among
  different operations via modulo scheduling and time multiplexing processing
  elements. In the emerging scenario where transistor resources are rich, we
  develop a novel CGRA architecture that features full pipelining and dynamic
  composition to improve energy efficiency and implement the prototype on Xilinx
  Virtex-6 FPGA board. Experiments show that fully pipelined and dynamically
  composable architecture(FPCA) can exploit the energy benefits of customization
  for user applications when the transistor resources are rich.
