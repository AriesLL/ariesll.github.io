abstract: >
  Customized pipeline designs that minimize the pipeline initiation interval
  (II) maximize the throughput of FPGA accelerators designed with high-level
  synthesis (HLS). What is the impact of minimizing II on energy efficiency?
  Using a matrix-multiply accelerator, we show that matrix multiplies with II>1
  can sometimes reduce dynamic energy below II=1 due to interconnect savings,
  but II=1 always achieves energy close to the minimum. We also identify sources
  of inefficient mapping in the commercial tool flow.
