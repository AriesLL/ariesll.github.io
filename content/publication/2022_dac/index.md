abstract: The complex nature of real-world problems calls for heterogeneity in
  both machine learning (ML) models and hardware systems. For the algorithm, the
  heterogeneity in ML models comes from the multi-sensor perceiving and
  multi-task learning, i.e., multi-modality multi-task (MMMT) models, resulting
  in diverse deep neural net- work (DNN) layers and computation patterns. For
  the system, it becomes prevailing to integrate dedicated acceleration
  components into one system. It thus introduces a new problem, heterogeneous
  model to heterogeneous system mapping (H2H), in which both computation and
  communication efficiency need to be considered. While previous mapping
  algorithms only focus on computation patterns, in this work, we propose a
  novel mapping algorithm with both computation and communication awareness. By
  slightly sacrificing computation efficiency, the communication latency is
  largely reduced. Therefore, the system overall performance is improved and
  energy is also reduced. The superior performance of our work is evaluated on
  MAESTRO, achieving 15%-74% latency improvement and 23%-64% energy reduction
  when compared with the existing computation-prioritized mapping algorithm.
